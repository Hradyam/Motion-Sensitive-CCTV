# Motion-Sensitive-CCTV

A security system that triggers video recording when motion is detected using an Arduino proximity sensor and Python-based video capture.

## 🌟 Features
- Real-time motion detection with proximity sensor
- Automatic video recording on trigger
- Serial communication between Arduino & Python
- Organized video storage in `outputs/` directory
- Adjustable recording duration
- Multiple video file management

## 🛠 Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno/Nano
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor (or similar proximity sensor)
- USB cable for Arduino
- Webcam (built-in or external)
- Jumper wires

## 💻 Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- PySerial (`pip install pyserial`)

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone Repository
2. Install Python dependencies:
   - use "pip install -requirements.txt"

## 🔌 Hardware Setup
1. Connect proximity sensor to Arduino:
   -VCC → 5V
   -GND → GND
   -TRIG → Digital Pin 9
   -ECHO → Digital Pin 10
2. Connect Arduino to computer via USB
3. Upload the trigger code from "trigger code" folder to the arduino after making relevant changes depending on your system

## 🚀 Usage
1. Create outputs directory:
2. Run Python script:
3. System will:
  - Monitor serial port for triggers
  - Start 10-second recording on detection
  - Save videos as `outputs/video_1.mp4`, `video_2.mp4`, etc.
  - Show live preview during recording

## 🛠 Troubleshooting
1. **Serial Port Issues**:
  - Check port name in `serial.Serial()` call
  - Ensure no other program is using the port
2. **Video Saving Problems**:
  - Verify `outputs/` directory exists
  - Check write permissions
3. **Sensor False Positives**:
  - Adjust `safetyDistance` in Arduino code
  - Modify debounce delay
